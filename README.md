2/21/23 - I am now beginning the Tic Tac Toe project as a part of The Odin Project's Javascript track. I will write an app that allows two people to play tic tac toe against each other. I will also attempt to implement an AI opponent for one player to play against.

4/10/23 - Finished the Tic Tac Toe project. This project took much longer than expected as I built my friend's artist website in the middle and was out sick for 2 weeks. Due to this, I decided to skip the extra credit project of adding an AI opponent in order to continue making progress with TOP and make up some lost time. I may come back later to implement an AI opponent. Otherwise, this project was a great learning experience for how to utilize modules and factory functions to structure my code. I especially had fun/difficulty figuring out how to code the win conditions. I really enjoyed solving that problem!
